### Hi there! <img src="https://emojis.slackmojis.com/emojis/images/1536351075/4594/blob-wave.gif" width="25"/>

I am Jefferson, a Systems Analyst and Developer based in SÃ£o Paulo, Brazil.

With a passion for technology and innovation, I am primarily interested in back-end development, constantly seeking to improve my knowledge and skills. Currently, I am focused on exploring the fascinating world of Generative AIs and integrating these technologies into innovative projects. I am particularly interested in how artificial intelligence can transform and enhance software development.

Outside of work, I am passionate about movies, always looking for new films and documentaries to watch. I am also a dedicated gamer and enjoy exploring the beauty of cities through my camera lens. Check out one of my projects: [Malta Through My Lens](https://www.behance.net/gallery/169869371/Malta-Through-My-Lens).
